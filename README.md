## Infection Project
The goal of this project is to give you an opportunity to code on the sort of problem that we would actually tackle here at Khan Academy.

### Setup: 
Running the infection simulation requires the following version of python: 

*   python 3.4 or above

Dependency requirements for this project can be found in the requirements.txt file. Install the requirements with the following command: 
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

The project should now be ready to run. 

### Running Tests: 
All the tests for this module are located in the `tests/infection_test.py` file. 

To run the tests, open up a terminal, cd to the root of the project, and type `nosetests` to run the tests. You should get an output like the text below: 

```
$ nosetests

.....
